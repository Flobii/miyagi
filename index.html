    <h2>The Range</h2>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step One</legend>
      <p>
        Start off by going to the Range. Set your Bots to <strong>Easy</strong> and give them <strong>Armor</strong>.
        Suit yourself with a <strong>Sheriff</strong> and infinite Ammunition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your goal in this Part is <strong>not to miss a Shot</strong>. You should focus on <strong>aiming at the
          Head</strong> and in Easy Mode there is pleanty of Time for you to hit them without getting stressed!
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on you can incorporate <strong>Movement</strong> into your Training. Discipline your Aim and do not
        hurry on shooting.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step Two</legend>
      <p>
        The next Step is using <strong>Medium</strong> Speed for the Bots. As before your Goal is to hit their
        <strong>Head</strong> and <strong>not hurrying</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is <strong>no Problem</strong> if you miss a couple of Shots!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ensure that you are aiming for the <strong>Head only</strong>, not going for the Body or Legs.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step Three</legend>
      <p>
        Now for the last Part in the Range. Set your Bots on <strong>50 Streak</strong> with <strong>Strafes
          on</strong>. Also upgrade your Sheriff to a <strong>Guardian</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Goal here is to <strong>track the Bots Movement</strong> a little bit before shooting <strong>for the
          Head</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first 10-25 Bots you can stop and go your on Way. I personally like tracking all 50 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some time you'll find a <strong>Rythm</strong>. If you need a harder Challenge, try setting the Bots to
        fast instead!
      </p>

    <h2>Deathmatch</h2>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step One</legend>
      <p>
        For the first few Minutes of the Deathmatch your only Goal is to <strong>track the Enemies</strong> without
        shooting yet. You want to <strong>observe the Movement</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely you will die a lot, but remember, you're not here to win, your Aim is to to <strong>track heads</strong>.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step Two</legend>
      <p>
        After tracking your Enemies for some time you can start going for <strong>Sheriff Kills</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some more Time, when you feel <strong>comfortable</strong> and have your <strong>Aim disciplined</strong>
        you can start going for <strong>Guardian Kills</strong>.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Step Three</legend>
      <p>
        After some more Time, when you're feeling comfortable with the Guardian, you can finally switch to the
        <strong>Vandal</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But still don't forget your Target. Deathmatch is not a Competition, you get Nothing from finishing first.
